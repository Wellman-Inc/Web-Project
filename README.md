# Web-Project
The Kentucky Artisan Project is in its infancy.  The intent is to highlight the many talents of a collective group of Kentuckians called "Artisans."  A video interview will be conducted that reveals the history/journey of the person that creates the art that is so important to our culture and heritage.  In addition to capturing the history and culture of each region, this website will provide contact information for each artist should someone want to contract for services.  Kentucky is rich with talented people that might not ever be recognized, and their story never told.  This website will catalog these special Kentuckians for posterity's sake through the use of the written word, videos, still photos, and recordings.
